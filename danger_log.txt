ECE568 project 1 ride sharing - danger log

1. Username duplication during new user sign up: the solution of reducing such duplication 
was that we explictly specified the clean() method within our sign up model form in views.py 
and thus enabling our website to check if current username has been taken. If it is taken, a 
forms.ValidationError will be displayed to let the user aware of this issue so that they can 
change another username, and the process continues.

2. Changing in username is hard to handle once users have created their accounts, thus while 
users can change other personal info such as displayed name, email address, password, etc., 
the change of username is not allowed.

3. When creating accounts/registering vehicle/requesting rides, or doing editing, it is possible 
that users do not enter some required information. This is handled in the database (when writing 
models.py) by setting these fields to non-nullable, and calling is_valid() in model form, to 
ensure these information has been written.

4. A user cannot be a driver and accept ride requests unless the user entered vehicle information. 
Thus, we added a check everytime the user performed a role select of being a driver, if there is no 
vehicle info associated with the user, we will redirect the user to vehicle registration page.
